## The Goal  
The goal here is to improve the default World Beacon crates in ARK, and yet not make them crazy overpowered (as many who edit them seem to make them - to each his own). I do not wish to replace/make useless the Sea Crates or Cave loot crates, or break the game with these replacement beacons here. For our server we wanted a healthy balance and crates that would improve the overall quality of the game. With this diligent crate re-code, the beacons will become more worthwhile in general. They will drop stuff that is useful to players of all levels and be be more exciting to hunt for. They will also feel more complete and filled out, including patterns for items that could only be crafted by spending engram points previously.  

### How are these new beacons different?  
They are more filled out. All the previously left out items have been added with the exception that any items found in Deep Sea loot crates (except in ScorchedEarth where the sea crates are redone). Items are in general grouped into the beacon close to the Engram Level. Rarity and odds are carefully balanced to make the best or most expensive items more rare, and explosives rare and in low quantities.  

Items with Quality Ratings will drop individual pieces or patterns and have a chance to have more quality. In extremely rare cases, the gear found here will be of very high quality. This is so rare, that you would have to be a dedicated beacon hunter (or just damn lucky) to come across the best of the gear. This rarity is on purpose so that it doesn't make cave crates useless. 

### How to use this code on your server?   
The easiest way to use this is to copy all the code from the file [FULL_DEPLOY_CODE under the Standard folder](Standard/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) or [under the Scorched Earth folder](ScorchedEarth/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) and paste it into your *game.ini* file, anywhere under the [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]. Then Save your server and restart it (be sure to warn your players so they dont lose stuff/can land their fliers, all that standard stuff). If you are still stuck on this, there is a lot of additional information out there about editing your game.ini file, just search Google.  

### Make your own versions  
Fork, Edit the code for the beacons, then run the **compile_code** powershell script to turn it into Full Deploy Code.
