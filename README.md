# Better Default World Beacons  

_Improved, yet not overpowered, default world beacons for custom (ARK: Survival Evovled[https://www.youtube.com/survivetheark]) servers._  


## How to use this code on your server?   
The easiest way to use this is to copy all the code from the file [FULL_DEPLOY_CODE under the Standard folder](Standard/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) or [under the Scorched Earth folder](ScorchedEarth/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) and paste it into your *game.ini* file, anywhere under the [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]. Then Save your server and restart it (be sure to warn your players so they dont lose stuff/can land their fliers, all that standard stuff). If you are still stuck on this, there is a lot of additional information out there about editing your game.ini file, just search Google.  

## The Goal  
The goal with this drop rework is to improve the Default World Beacon crates in ARK, and focus on balancing for what would really make sense, while aiming to not make them overpowered. I do not wish to replace/make useless the Sea Crates or Cave loot crates, or break the game with these replacement beacons. For our server we wanted a healthy balance and crates that would improve the overall quality of the game. They will drop stuff that is useful to players of all levels and be be more exciting to hunt for. 

## How are these new beacons different?  
They are more filled out. All the previously left out items have been added with the exception that any items found in Deep Sea loot crates (except in ScorchedEarth where the sea crates are redone). Items are in general grouped into the beacon close to the Engram Level. Rarity and odds are carefully balanced to make the best or most expensive items more rare, and explosives rare and in low quantities.  

Items with Quality Ratings (Weapons, Armor, Saddles) drop individual pieces or patterns and are scaled up slightly in Double Crates (they have rings on them). Finding extremely high quality pieces is very rare on a server 4 difficulty. This rarity scales up or down along with game server difficulty as normal.

### Make your own versions  
Fork, Edit the code for the beacons, then run the **compile_code** powershell script (most versions of Windows will do this as far as I know) to turn it into Full Deploy Code. To learn more about editing beacons, google is your best friend. There is a lot of useful information out there. I you look at the broken down, syntaxed code on my Github it will probably begin to make sense.
