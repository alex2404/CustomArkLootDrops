## The Goal  
The goal here is to improve the default World Beacon crates in ARK, and yet not make them crazy overpowered (as many who edit them seem to make them - to each his own). I do not wish to replace/make useless the Sea Crates or Cave loot crates, or break the game with these replacement beacons here. For our server we wanted a healthy balance and crates that would improve the overall quality of the game. With this diligent crate re-code, the beacons will become more worthwhile in general. They will drop stuff that is useful to players of all levels and be be more exciting to hunt for. They will also feel more complete and filled out, including patterns for items that could only be crafted by spending engram points previously.  

### How to use this code on your server?  
The easiest way to use this is to copy all the code from the file [FULL_DEPLOY_CODE under the Standard folder](Standard/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) or [under the Scorched Earth folder](ScorchedEarth/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE) and paste it into your *game.ini* file, anywhere under the [/script/shootergame.shootergamemode]. Then Save your server and restart it (be sure to warn your players so they dont lose stuff/can land their fliers, all that standard stuff). If you are still stuck on this, there is a lot of additional information out there about editing your game.ini file, just search Google.  

### A puny, partly true story.
It all started when a group of us, as new players, began to notice that the default world beacons are rather disappointing and thus pointless, even game ruining. They quite literally brought about anger. The hunt, the danger, the though of something new and exciting, all to be foiled by ... you guessed it - yet another Medium Crop Plot, Compass, or Water Jar Blueprint. For weeks we seethed, becoming more bitter with each beacon fought for. Then I sought justice, and drafted a better new default table, deftly and swiftly defeating the terrible charts that once were. Morale improved. The heavy drinking slowed. Fighting for beacons became a reasonable goal. Patterns that never existed began to appear. Players rejoiced across the land.

### How are these new beacons different? 
As stated with the goal, they are more filled out. Quite literally, all the previously left out items have been added with the exception that any items found in Deep Sea loot crates (as the devs intended). Newly added items are in general grouped into the beacon close to the engram level. Rarity and odds are carefully balanced to make the best or most expensive items more rare.   

Any items with quality ratings will drop individual pieces or patterns only and have a (rather small) chance to be improved beyond what was capable before. In extremely rare cases, the gear found here will be of very high quality. This is so rare, that you would have to be a dedicated beacon hunter (or just damn lucky) to come across the best of the gear. This rarity is on purpose so that it doesn't make cave crates useless. 

### What is the Special Event Version?  
The [FULL_DEPLOY_CODE_special_event](Standard/EpicCrateDayEvent/FULL_DEPLOY_CODE_special_event) is a more powerful version of the standard (not Scorched Earth) world beacons intended for special events. *These crates have all the normal stuff and also include a ~50% chance to drop special loot. Additionally, all items with quality have increased quality in these crates.*  
* Whites drop electronics or gas  
* Green drops tranq darts or arrows 
* Blue drops cementing paste, metal ingot, or angler gel  
* Purple drops polymer or black pearls  
* Yellow drops an ammo crate  
* Red drops Deep Sea Crate items (but not quite as high of quality as the artifact crates).  
  
**In general use the normal code, not the special event, unless you really want to have much more powerful crates.**
  
### Make your own versions  
Edit the code for the beacons, then run the **compile_code** powershell script to turn it into Full Deploy Code.
