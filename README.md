#  CustomArkLootDrops

_Improved and rebalanced default world beacons for hosted [ARK: Survival Evolved](https://www.youtube.com/survivetheark) servers._  
* This code is designed for PC servers. Sorry XBOX and PS4 players, it's nothing personal, I just only play PC.
* Designed with _Balance_ in mind. I listen to feedback and update this code accordingly. If you noticed unbalanced things let me know.

## The Goal  
The goal with this drop rework is to improve the Default World Beacon crates in ARK: Survival Evolved, and focus on balancing for what would really make sense, while aiming to not make the drops too overpowered. This code should improve the usefulness of beacons as well as make them more exciting to hunt for. The rare promise of truly unexpected finds will keep players coming back.

## How are these new beacons different?  
* They are much more filled out. Nearly all the previously left out items have been added in. There are some exceptions, such as the Standard Deep Sea loot crate items are left out in Standard. The Scorched Earth version has been further reworked to update the crates based on scorched earth unique items and dinos and the Deep _Sand_ crates have been reworked to remove unusable items.
* In general, new items are grouped to a beacon color near its Engram Level.  
* Rarity and odds are carefully balanced to make the best or most expensive items most rare, and explosives always in low quantities.  
* Items with Quality Ratings (Weapons, Armor, Saddles) drop individual pieces or patterns and are scaled up slightly in Double Crates (they have rings on them). Finding extremely high quality pieces is very rare on a server 4 difficulty. This rarity scales up or down along with game server difficulty as normal.
  
### You are welcome to Edit the code and even make your own versions  
Fork or Download then Edit the code for the beacons. After editing, run the **compile_code** powershell script (most versions of Windows can do this) to turn it into a new FULL_DEPLOY_CODE file. To learn more about editing beacons, Google is your best friend. There is a lot of useful information out there. If you look at the broken down, syntaxed code on my Github it will probably begin to make sense.

## Support  
*If you've found this code useful, please consider donating to help keep this project alive. It's more than just a quick recode, its a rebalance as well. Hours of my life do go into it ;)*
